Stored here are a few of the more successful craft designs that I have
created for KSP 1.0+. They require MechJeb2 but are otherwise stock.
Have fun and fly safe!

## Craft Overview

 * `SPH/Buggy.craft`: Useful for transporting a single Kerbal around
   the KSC for reference flag planting duty and other boring tasks.
 * `VAB/Diskovery+Lifter-II.craft`: My first successful Space Shuttle
   clone. It actually flies pretty well.
 * `VAB/Kolossal-IV.craft`: A huge SSTO rocket, useful for refueling
   missions. Remember to deploy the airbrakes before reentering.
 * `VAB/Komodo-III.craft`: A simple SSTO space taxi, decouple the orbiter
   once in space and it and the ascent stage are landable.
 * `VAB/Lifter+CSM+Gerridae.craft`: An Apollo inspired MÃ¼n mission craft.
